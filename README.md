# CaribouDuet-Config-and-Macros

This repository contains the source code and the development versions of the configuration and macros running on the Original CaribouDuet line of printers.

# Naming convention

Sorting order is height / Thermistor / Sensor

### Thermistor

1. N = E3d thermistor and Slice Engineering thermistor (white cable) up to 300°C
2. H = Slice Engineering High Temperature Thermistor (black cable) up to 450°C

(old, before version 1.3.0)

1. E = E3d thermistor
2. S = Slice Engineering Thermistor (black cable)


### Sensor
1. P = PINDA2
2. SP = SuperPINDA
3. BLL = BL-Touch Left installation
4. BLR = BL-Touch Right installation


Example:

CaribouDuet220-NSP = 220 version with E3d  or SE thermistor and PINDA2

CaribouDuet320-HBLL = 320 version with SE HT thermistor and BL-Touch Left



# Build

In your preferred Unix environment follow these steps

1. Clone this repository and checkout the correct branch for your desired release version.
2. change into the directory `CaribouDuet-Configuration-and-Macros`
3. execute `./CC-build.sh`
4. select the desired configuration or build all configurations
5. in case you only built one version you will find a zipped output file in `../CC-build`
6. in case you built all versions copy `./sort.sh` to `../CC-build`
7. change to th edirectory `../CC-build`
8. execute `./sort.sh`. Options are the start and target directory for the sorted files example `./sort.sh CC110-Build26/ CC110-Build26-sorted
`
9. the script will create all required directories and sort the out that was generated buy `CC-build.sh`

# Set-up

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to Bernd Brinkert and Daniel Heimbeck for support and discussions on various items and issues!!

Support for BL-Touch for installation on the right side was initiated by Michael Müller.

We would like to thank 3d-gussner for his effort when we started this project. The CC-build and the sorting scripts have their roots in the PF-build and sorting scripts for building the Prusa firmware which were developed by 3d-gussner.

We're thankful to rkolbi for providing his scripts and documentation to us at an early stage. His repository can be found at https://github.com/rkolbi/RRF-machine-config-files/tree/master/Prusa%20MK3s
